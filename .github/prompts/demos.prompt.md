I'm working on a training content around GitHub Copilot, GitHub Copilot agent mode in VSCode, GitHub Copilot Coding Agent and MCP.
I need to create multiple demos:
- GitHub Copilot agent mode in VSCode
- GitHub Copilot Coding Agent
- GitHub Copilot agent mode in VSCode with MCP
- GitHub Copilot Coding Agent with MCP
- Update a local MCP server

For this, I want to create an application (a basic one) where some basic features will be missing so we can add them during the demos. I also want to build an MCP server, something basic, short, easy that we can customize during the demos. This MCP server has to be useful during the demos where we will add new features.

Can you help define which type of application and MCP could fit this please? And which type of demos I can do?

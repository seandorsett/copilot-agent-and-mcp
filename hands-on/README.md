4. Verify the application is running correctly

## Part 1: GitHub Copilot Coding Agent (15-20 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Basic Feature Addition

1. Create an issue for adding a "Clear All Favorites" button
2. Use Copilot Agent to implement the feature by:
   - Assigning the issue to Copilot
   - Checking the ðŸ‘€ reaction
   - Reviewing the generated PR
   - Understanding the changes made
   - Testing the implementation

### Exercise 2: Feature Enhancement

1. Create an issue to add sorting options for the book list (by title, author)
2. Follow the same process as Exercise 1
3. Review and discuss how Copilot Agent:
   - Understands the codebase
   - Makes changes across multiple files
   - Implements both frontend and backend changes
   - Adds appropriate tests

### Exercise 3: Complex Feature with Multiple Issues

1. Create three issues for implementing book reviews functionality:
  - Frontend issue: UI components for adding/displaying reviews
  - Backend issue: API endpoints and database changes for reviews
  - Main feature issue: Link to both frontend and backend issues
2. Configure the MCP server for Copilot Coding Agent:
  - Set up the GitHub MCP server connection
  - Configure access permissions
  - Test the connection
3. Assign the main issue to Copilot:
  - Ensure Copilot
  - Watch how Copilot:
    * Has access to read linked issues
    * Reads and understands linked issues
    * Coordinates frontend and backend changes
    * Implements the complete feature
4. Review the generated PR and validate:
  - Frontend changes match the requirements
  - Backend API implementation
  - Test coverage for both layers
  - Integration between components

## Part 2: GitHub Copilot Chat Agent Mode with MCP (15-20 minutes)

### Exercise 4: Implementing Book Search

1. Open VS Code with Agent Mode enabled
2. Use Chat Agent Mode to implement a search feature in the books list that:
  - Allows users to search books by title or author
  - Adds a search input field in the UI
  - Filters the book list in real-time
  - Includes clear search functionality

### Exercise 5: Adding Book Categories

1. Use the GitHub MCP server to create an issue to describe the feature request
2. Have Copilot:
   - Create a detailed issue description
   - Suggest implementation approach in the issue
3. Implement the feature following the issue guidelines
4. Explore how Chat Agent Mode:
  - Creates well-structured issues
  - Handles the implementation
  - Adds necessary tests
